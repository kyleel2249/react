Kidney infections, also known as <b><i>pyelonephritis<\/i><\/b>, can be a serious health issue if left untreated. They are caused by bacteria or viruses that travel up the urinary tract and infect the kidneys. The most common bacteria that cause kidney infections is E. coli, but other bacteria can also be responsible.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the symptoms of a kidney infection typically include fever, chills, back pain, nausea, vomiting,<br \/>\nand frequent urination. Some people may also experience pain or a burning sensation when urinating.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">DANGERS OF KIDNEY INFECTIONS<\/h2>\n<p>Kidney infections can be dangerous and lead to serious complications, such as kidney damage or sepsis if left untreated or not treated promptly. One of the most serious complications of kidney infections is kidney scarring, which can lead to chronic kidney disease, high blood pressure, and kidney failure. This is<br \/>\nbecause the infection can cause damage to the kidney tissue, which can lead to reduced kidney function over time.<\/p>\n<p>Another potential complication of kidney infections is sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the infection spreads throughout the body. Sepsis can cause organ failure and can be difficult to treat, especially if it is not diagnosed early.<\/p>\n<p>Additional complications of kidney infections can include permanent kidney damage, which can lead to ongoing kidney problems, as well as the spread of the infection to other parts of the body.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to seek medical attention if you suspect you have a kidney infection, as prompt treatment can help prevent these serious complications and promote a faster recovery. Treatment typically involves antibiotics and plenty of fluids to help flush out the infection, but in severe cases, hospitalization may be<br \/>\nnecessary.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">SYMPTOMS OF KIDNEY INFECTIONS<\/h2>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>\u00a0Pain or pressure in the lower abdomen or groin<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Painful or frequent urination<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Strong-smelling urine<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Cloudy or dark urine<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the symptoms of a kidney infection can be similar to other conditions, such as a bladder infection or kidney stones. If you experience any of these symptoms, it&#8217;s important to see a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.<\/p>\n<p>As previously mentioned, antibiotics are typically the first line of treatment for kidney infections. In addition to antibiotics, pain relievers and plenty of fluids may also be recommended to help manage symptoms and flush out the infection. It&#8217;s important to take all medications as prescribed and to follow<br \/>\nyour doctor&#8217;s instructions for managing the infection and preventing complications.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF KIDNEY INFECTIONS<\/h2>\n<ol style=\"margin-top: 0in;\" start=\"1\" type=\"1\">\n<li style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\"><b>Scarring:<\/b> Long-term kidney infections can cause scarring of the kidney tissue, which can lead to<br \/>\ndecreased kidney function and chronic kidney disease. This can happen when the infection causes pus to collect and create an abscess inside the kidney tissue.<\/li>\n<li style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\"><b>High blood pressure: <\/b>Scarring of the kidney tissue can also lead to high blood pressure, which<br \/>\ncan further damage the kidneys and increase the risk of heart disease.<\/li>\n<li style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\"><b>Kidney failure:<\/b>\u00a0Long-term kidney infections can cause permanent damage to the kidneys, which can<br \/>\nlead to kidney failure. This occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to filter waste from the blood.<\/li>\n<li style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\"><b>Sepsis:<\/b> Long-term kidney infections can also increase the risk of sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body&#8217;s response to infection causes damage to its own tissues and organs.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">TREATMENT OF KIDNEY INFECTIONS<\/h2>\n<p>Kidney infections are typically treated with antibiotics to clear the infection. The type of antibiotic prescribed may depend on the severity of the infection and the specific bacteria causing it.<\/p>\n<p>Drinking plenty of fluids is also important to help flush out the infection and prevent dehydration. It&#8217;s essential to complete the full course of antibiotics prescribed by your doctor, even if you start feeling better before the medication is finished. This helps ensure that the infection is fully cleared<br \/>\nand reduces the risk of complications.<\/p>\n<p>In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary to receive intravenous antibiotics and fluids. This may be recommended if you are unable to take oral medications, have a high fever, or are experiencing severe symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>Other treatment options may include using a urinary catheter to drain urine from the bladder if you are unable to urinate normally or undergoing surgery to remove an obstruction in the urinary tract that may be contributing to the infection.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the treatment for kidney infections will depend on the severity of the infection and the underlying cause. It&#8217;s important to follow your doctor&#8217;s instructions for treatment and to seek medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms or complications. Doctors will often prescribe antibiotics<br \/>\nto treat kidney infections, and it is important to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed to ensure that the infection is fully treated. In addition to prompt treatment of kidney infections, maintaining good kidney health can help prevent chronic kidney infections. This includes staying hydrated, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, managing blood pressure and blood sugar levels, and maintaining a healthy diet and weight.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, kidney infections can have lasting effects on kidney health, including scarring, high blood pressure, kidney failure, and sepsis. Prompt treatment of acute kidney infections and maintaining good kidney health can help prevent chronic kidney infections and their long-term effects on kidney health.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/web.facebook.com\/healthychoice101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Make a choice to stay healthy.<\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>____________________________________________________________________________<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>TAGS:<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/web.facebook.com\/samuel.archimedes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SAMUEL NTIAMOAH<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.facebook.com\/healthychoice101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HEALTHY CHOICE<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/health\/family\/uti-symptoms-and-treatments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FORBES<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>____________________________________________________________________________<\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this article, we will discuss what Kidney Infections are, their symptoms, causes, and treatment as explained by the Medical Health Professional and Team Lead of Healthy Choice, Mr. Samuel Ntiamoah.
