Anger doesn\u2019t quite describe it. It\u2019s an extreme and inexplicable feeling of time wasted and unfulfillment. Hanging out with people felt like a job, something I had to do without being able to hit the stop button. It had nothing to do with the people but everything to do with me. On some very rare occasions too, I found myself wanting more. I found myself wanting to get used to how someone made me feel. Those moments were scary, they had to stop.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEjKBFcxvW32ZbhjPoBke39xmsIilvGbJ4GUcCljCN4jWpmThVEq7Nswubbt53AFBFfpSyrvjrfj--a7A5yNg1UXBcdnhZy9B3n5e_9sGWIYQ18mcrqciJgh4iZJqTmumM6QoemlRA9L2BnjBDlXG1OY4sbEBoazzaydoJyRrw7aIq5WDzZEXZsvRw5kNQ\/s480\/giphy%20(4).gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEjKBFcxvW32ZbhjPoBke39xmsIilvGbJ4GUcCljCN4jWpmThVEq7Nswubbt53AFBFfpSyrvjrfj--a7A5yNg1UXBcdnhZy9B3n5e_9sGWIYQ18mcrqciJgh4iZJqTmumM6QoemlRA9L2BnjBDlXG1OY4sbEBoazzaydoJyRrw7aIq5WDzZEXZsvRw5kNQ\/w640-h360\/giphy%20(4).gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"270\" data-original-width=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><\/div>\n<p>I say I hate to be alone, but I hate it even more being around people for long. I\u2019m not toxic but I can be some type of way. Staying around people for long brings out a part of me that\u2019s bad for their mental health. But it\u2019s unintentional, I just have a habit of being selfish with my own happiness, especially post-heartbreak. I put myself first and I always choose the easy way out of awkward situations. So, when I started feeling overwhelmed by all the different people and different things I was feeling, the simple solution was to detach. As usual, I didn\u2019t care how the other person would feel.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEjqCrNnP0-r_FRoijverLL9ydaqF4b3bhui3L4vGCbSVNt_NI3jqwz33S_YDAeit55ecbx1F5EblGQVqoN5D4jpz_afWs3l1tYm9JyTa2BxIw5DeE4-eAH5NYlR6Rus-sk15fiXBVtVp2jtgCMMaYgDydVjpIx3V9JzPfY3O5seut8ZbIDZl3fMS6k0-g\/s500\/giphy%20(5).gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEjqCrNnP0-r_FRoijverLL9ydaqF4b3bhui3L4vGCbSVNt_NI3jqwz33S_YDAeit55ecbx1F5EblGQVqoN5D4jpz_afWs3l1tYm9JyTa2BxIw5DeE4-eAH5NYlR6Rus-sk15fiXBVtVp2jtgCMMaYgDydVjpIx3V9JzPfY3O5seut8ZbIDZl3fMS6k0-g\/w640-h350\/giphy%20(5).gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"273\" data-original-width=\"500\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<p>I gave myself the month of May to break free from everyone, more like break up with everyone. But the more I detached, the more I met new people to replace the people I was detaching from. It felt like I was caught in an entanglement loop.

But some weeks ago, we got back in touch and I began to see things differently. True. he\u2019s not quite my type of guy, but I have to admit, he is interesting and great company by all standards. Aha! Did I mention that he cooks? He\u2019s an excellent cook and he cooks me lunch and supper every day. For someone like me who hates cooking and has been considered an unsuitable wife material because of it, this guy would have been perfect for me. But I guess it takes more than food, gifts and great company to want to be with someone. Having to tell a guy who genuinely likes you that you\u2019re unable to return his feelings isn\u2019t one of those things that gets easy with practice. Cowardly of me, I did it over text. Remember when I said I choose the easy way out of awkward situations? I meant it. For a whole day he tried to reach me so we talk things over. I really was going to ghost but the guy did deserve better. So yes, we met up and talked. I caught a hint of the discomfort in his demeanour. I could tell he was trying so hard to not come off as overly bothered. I tried to make him stop bringing me food but he said cooking for me is the highlight of his day and who am I to stand in the way of someone\u2019s happiness? Long story short, we are friends who have a clear understanding of where we stand, at least I do. I won\u2019t be responsible for any future hurt and I hope somehow, he moves on from me. I\u2019d love that.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEg1mJ7pPgdRsvF_604ZXJZue4mVMAduonPWtaDsdFKE3WUrwW4TBgC2TJuugV1ns7bnXiElHMvuBaS3XJAvh8MxT0DGi2sGyvMseq45wdmZf_ud05ueWXuUqmUFazZe3xzyZFNI0UdyPoqjYzQdmVGA_gFY3RpsOz6kGXfyHk-uOVk4vH6qERLl6xgdRA\/s480\/giphy%20(7).gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEg1mJ7pPgdRsvF_604ZXJZue4mVMAduonPWtaDsdFKE3WUrwW4TBgC2TJuugV1ns7bnXiElHMvuBaS3XJAvh8MxT0DGi2sGyvMseq45wdmZf_ud05ueWXuUqmUFazZe3xzyZFNI0UdyPoqjYzQdmVGA_gFY3RpsOz6kGXfyHk-uOVk4vH6qERLl6xgdRA\/w640-h426\/giphy%20(7).gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"320\" data-original-width=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<h3>#Guy2<\/h3>\n<p>My friendship with this guy is 2 boyfriends old. He gave me the clarity I needed to get out of the first relationship and was very instrumental in my healing process after the 2nd relationship. Nothing could ever go on between us, but we spend so much time together it feels like a relationship and I get overwhelmed sometimes with the responsibility it comes with. There\u2019re some emotions invested but the reason we can never be together is beyond both of us. People who know me can identify guys I talk about but nobody knows about this guy and that\u2019s what bothers me about this entanglement. I hate to be with someone I can\u2019t talk about. If I want my next relationship to succeed, then this is a necessary disentanglement. But I fumbled with it, I couldn\u2019t go straight to the point. (I\u2019m beginning to see a pattern here, I\u2019m a relationship coward after all) To be fair, if this was a sexual relationship, it\u2019d have been way easier but this is too difficult. I\u2019m still trying to detach and I think he\u2019s seen through my act. I hope he makes this easy for me. I\u2019d like to move on.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEi75jwfSicKzpYE8EfBUJIoAZH3fojzePN3fqnXUCuKfFcFtFMHb19wTjzX-zd_1chRoESwDlDpjGNiNJt6MVHfMhj4PgKhYbtPJpOIoeLWhYL2X0-qvkW90XzF8RmFjNBsR1b_tmYr3Lpad0zOQ6OgWNlPeYCkZ_saPhcHzZPEWxn-LZkGWvl-2ui8qA\/s500\/giphy%20(5).gif\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/blogger.googleusercontent.com\/img\/b\/R29vZ2xl\/AVvXsEi75jwfSicKzpYE8EfBUJIoAZH3fojzePN3fqnXUCuKfFcFtFMHb19wTjzX-zd_1chRoESwDlDpjGNiNJt6MVHfMhj4PgKhYbtPJpOIoeLWhYL2X0-qvkW90XzF8RmFjNBsR1b_tmYr3Lpad0zOQ6OgWNlPeYCkZ_saPhcHzZPEWxn-LZkGWvl-2ui8qA\/w640-h350\/giphy%20(5).gif\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"273\" data-original-width=\"500\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<h3>#Guy3<\/h3>\n<p>This one hurt the most because it wasn\u2019t my plan to disentangle from this guy. In hindsight, I feel I was disentangling to focus on my feelings for him. We\u2019ve been through years of going around our feelings and I wanted to bring some finality to it. No more \u201cwill-we-won\u2019t-we\u201d drama. Unfortunately, just when I had broken free from everyone, we drifted apart. Remember when I said I was some type of way? yeah, he noticed. We got in touch and he said some pretty hurtful but somewhat true things and ended with the fact that I\u2019ve always taken him for granted. My heart sank and broke. It hurt like the heartbreak I had just healed from. I could have defended myself more but I didn\u2019t. I like this guy more than he knows it but If he wanted to walk out of my life, I wasn\u2019t going to stop him. Somehow, I have gotten used to watching people I care about walk out of my life.<\/p>\n<div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oK9wqtAwnoE\" width=\"559\" height=\"266\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>I\u2019m not all disentangled yet because well, it\u2019s a messy loop but I have better control of the situation now. Disentangling is not a walk in the park but it\u2019s a necessary evil. In the long run, you\u2019d both be grateful someone had the courage to walk away. One thing I\u2019ve learned though, is never to mince words when breaking up with someone. You don\u2019t want to be misunderstood and you don\u2019t want someone sensing some hope when what you really want, is to be free from them.<\/p>\n<h3>TAGS:<\/h3>\n<p><b>____________________________________________________<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CANDIDVIBEZ<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\/blogger\/search\/label\/Lifestyle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LIFESTYLE<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ENTANGLEMENT<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SITUATIONSHIP<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https:\/\/candidvibez.wordpress.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UNDEFINED RELATIONSHIP<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>____________________________________________________<\/b><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m guessing everyone does a relationship check every once in a while to evaluate which relationships to redefine, which ones to halt, and which ones to continue.
