This alone as noted, can pose a threat to the health of the general public, if care is not taken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been reported that In Axim-Bewire alone, more than sixty (60) mammals (almost like dolphins) washed ashore were counted on Sunday, April 4, 2021, by the natives of the area (Axim-Bewire). Some of the fish species noticed in Osu in Accra were washed ashore on Friday, April 2, 2021. Also, there has been a lot of dead tuna that has been washed ashore In Keta, Volta Region of Ghana on Sunday, April 4, 2021.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it&#8217;s not clear the cause of these fish being washed ashore dead, the Officers from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in these areas are so afraid that it will pose a threat to the health of the general public when consumed and faced with hard times as they try to prevent members of the public in that area from consuming the fish or even have close contacts with them because they are regarded as very risky to the Public&#8217;s health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, it was reported that sixty (60) of these mammals have gone missing from the shore at Axim-Bewire, in the Western Region and It is believed that the people who took them are going to process them for consumption as an alternative to buying them in the market since they attract very high prices when sold in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/mammals4_1-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2479\" width=\"495\" height=\"355\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, a statement issued by the Fisheries Commission on Sunday, April 4, 2021, indicates that information got to the commission in relation to the incident on Saturday, April 3, 2021, and by that statement which was issued by the Executive Director of the Fisheries Commission, Michael Arthur-Dadzie again, indicates that a team from the Fisheries Scientific Survey Division of the Fisheries Commission and also the Fish Health Unit was sent to the area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As at now, it is in the Public&#8217;s interest that the Fisheries Commission and the Marine Police Unit of the Ghana Police Service are on their way to the scene in order to help resolve or contain the situation and if possible retrieve them from those processing it for consumption before it is too late.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In view of these, the general public is advised to be careful with the fish they consume from the market until it is resolved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lot of fish from the sea were found dead and washed ashore in Axim, Keta, and Osu, in Ghana but with an unknown cause, however, believed to be a result of a chemical spill.
