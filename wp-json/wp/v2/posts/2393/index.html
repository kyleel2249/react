Whiles those who are not so happy about the issue accused Achimota Senior High School of being discriminatory, hypocrites and racists, others wished the students who were denied admission into the school would look elsewhere until the case is resolved. One of those interviewed (name withheld) says, &#8220;I think the school has its rules so if there is a need for the students to cut their locks and go to school, that\u2019s fine . However, If they can\u2019t, they should go to a different school.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, after a lot of interactions, these were comments or concerns raised:<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/repentedanalyst.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/img-20210324-wa0011_1.jpg?w=563\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2405\" width=\"155\" height=\"144\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Esther Serwah<br>Midwife | Poet | Art Lover | News Blogger | Editor | Entrepreneur<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>The school is probably being lambasted because they treat others differently. My school (St. Mary&#8217;s) for instance, all foreigners had to cut their hair, and some level of length was allowed even Ghanaians with afro but it must be kept neat. So I feel if they are neat and certain standards are established then it&#8217;s not a problem. My point is those things are quite irrelevant. And the parents should also realise that some things are more important than others. You know it all constitutes to some level of discipline. They (Achimota) feel once they condone, there would be instability when it comes to discipline there, as well as that of the rules and regulations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/repentedanalyst.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/img-20210324-wa0015_1.jpg?w=389\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2408\" width=\"161\" height=\"179\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Wise Kobby Bonney, Entrepreneur<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>What will happen if Achimota admits them with their dreadlocks? Why do we always discriminate against our own blacks? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile they have Caucasians with long hairs. What makes them so special from those blacks with locks? Is Achimota greater than GES? So because of the locks, you are denying them from their rights to education? So, will they be allowed if they have perming and weave-on? Meanwhile, the school admits white people with locks and denies local people with locks. We are living in a confused generation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is that code not affecting the foreign students? Black man will always want to show how powerful he is over his fellow but not the whites. Due to this, St John&#8217;s Grammar also started withdrawing an already admitted student with dreadlocks. Isn&#8217;t that funny?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rules that discriminates. Is that one too a rule? Next time they should let us know their discrimination code before we select their school. Does a society supercedes a nation? Definitely, no! Same comparison applies to Achimota and GES. Rastafarians are not bad people. Accept them. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the year of return, as recorded, almost half of the visitors were Rastafarians. If they knew Ghana wouldn&#8217;t accept their kids in some schools, they wouldn&#8217;t have come at all. If the students knew that too, they wouldn&#8217;t have applied for the school (Achimota). They should accept their faults and admit the students because the public was not aware of their code. Now that everyone is aware of this ridiculous code, dreadlock students will divert their path to different schools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/repentedanalyst.files.wordpress.com\/2021\/03\/images.jpeg?w=225\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2410\" width=\"168\" height=\"168\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Offei Darlington, Accra-Ghana<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>Ah! I don&#8217;t see why they aren&#8217;t allowed into the school.

Is it part of the school&#8217;s code because they&#8217;re whites? Smh! Ghana!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone is entitled to his or her beliefs.

The parents of the students can also go as far as the laws of the land may permit them.
