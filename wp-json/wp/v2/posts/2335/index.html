Almost everyone who is in favor of Achimota\u2019s decision not to admit (black) students with their hair or dreadlocks on has made the misleading point of people having to stick to rules and regulations in every institution they find themselves. (When in Rome, do as the Romans do\u2026 &#8211; St. Ambrose).<br>Are you aware that in that very school, there are (Caucasian) students who have their hair unperturbed just because they have foreign fathers and have kept their hair before their admission to the school?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you aware that the kinky hair Ghanaians possess can be locked by itself if no external device is used on it after a long time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you by extension, inferring that the foreign students in Achimota have a different set of rules being applied to them?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our inability to reason about how we are negatively affecting children\u2019s confidence in themselves, our general ability to question obsolete rules, our own ability to accept change because we are so much used to our way of life that anything which seems to alter it immediately makes us uncomfortable, will always compel us to be arguing about irrelevant issues as allowing (Ghanaian) children to keep their hair (in government institutions) instead of finding ways to nurture their inquisitiveness and intelligence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next disturbing issue regarding this topic is the general unhealthy stereotype associated to people with locs\/rasta\/dreadlocks. I remember talking to my boyfriend about locking my hair and he was not happy about it because of the misconception about people with locs. It is about time we started viewing people as humans first before we even associated a behavior pattern with them just because they are not like us or do not practice beliefs\/doctrines as the status quo. So long as our fellow humans have not given us a reason to be prejudiced, the least we can do is give them the room to be \u2018innocent until proven guilty\u2019 and not otherwise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that before anyone was a Rastafarian, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, an atheist, etc., they were human beings first!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Almost everyone who is in favor of Achimota\u2019s decision not to admit (black) students with their hair or dreadlocks on has made a misleading point&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3919,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"gallery","meta":[],"categories":[17,24],"tags":[91,104,203,259,421],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.9 -
