And that It was all to just deceive the citizens of the country to believe that the GES\u00a0goes\u00a0to revive\u00a0the peace. So Ghana should\u00a0bear in mind\u00a0how the matter has now unfolded and at this meeting, GES supported the position of Achimota headmistress, and that has made the Rastafarian council shocked at GES\u2019s reaction towards the brouhaha. So instead, they will look for another alternative to resolve it without compromising their beliefs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people expressed concern about the ongoing brouhaha, as well as agitated, wishing for the wrath of God would visit Achimota School if they do not admit dreadlocks students.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/achimota1-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3902\" width=\"572\" height=\"357\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>As to whether the refusal was about style and preference or religion, appears to be more disturbing to the Rastafarian Council implying that they should wear their hairs low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whiles interacting with quite a number of people to express their opinion on the dreadlocks saga. A young man who wants to be anonymous, said, <strong><em>\u201cEven if I were the headmistress of Achimota, I would do the same probably, not because I want to, but I have been entrusted with a dress code I must uphold and until that dress code is amended, I cannot make an exception for one child at the expense of the code and be seen as one who is not firm. People should rather call for the amendment rather than try to create the impression that the kid is going to be victimized.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked why does he think the parents of the students were not willing to agree with the head of Achimota school, he pointed out that all second-cycle schools do not have the same standing orders or dress code, and that it is the reason for Muslim girls in some schools cannot use their \u2018head gear\u2019 even though they wish they could. He also added that <strong><em>\u201cIf this dress code problem would be solved, there must be a blanket code for all schools across the nation.\u201d<\/em><\/strong> The young man further expressed his concern as he continued, <strong><em>\u201cI don\u2019t have a side. My issue is with people making the school\u2019s management look bad. The headmistress and the members of the school management are only upholding the codes they have come to meet. She may not like the idea of asking the kids to cut their locks but her hands are tied by the rules governing the school. And again, a legitimate means must be sort to address the matter rather than the parents and those in support trying to bulldoze their way through. Once they succeed without adopting the appropriate resolution, the school may become ungovernable in the future. The rules of the school must not be pushed over for anyone who feels they have a special interest.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked if Ghana Education Service (GES) might somehow succeed in influencing the decision of the management or council of Achimota School, he said, <strong><em>\u201cGES cannot ask any school to gloss over their rules and regulations because they don\u2019t have that locus. It is the court that is clothed with the power to impress upon the schools to do otherwise. Going about the whole issue with force makes it illegitimate and when precedence of the nature is allowed to slip through, we will soon have a state of anarchists. Achimota is an institution on its own and GES is just a regulator without the mandate to operate the internal affairs of schools. Since Achimota is not untouchable, the court can order them to scrap that rule, but since the court hasn\u2019t done that yet as at now, the rule still stands. Now that there are international schools willing to offer them admission with full scholarships, they ought to go there.\u201d<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for more updates.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cEven if I were the headmistress of Achimota, I would do same probably, not because I want to, but I have been entrusted with a dress code I must uphold and until that dress code is amended, I cannot make an exception for one child at the expense of the code and be seen as one who is not firm&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3916,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"gallery","meta":[],"categories":[4,17],"tags":[39,92,148,201,360],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.9 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\r\n<title>Dreadlocks Saga;
