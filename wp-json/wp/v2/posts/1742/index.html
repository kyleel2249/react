More importantly, any device not running at least Ice Cream Sandwich &#8211; Android 4.0.3 or, iPhone not running iOS 9 or newer, will no longer be able to open or operate the Facebook-owned app &#8211; <strong>Whatsapp<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Android phones or devices that will lose WhatsApp support include the LG Optimus Black, Samsung Galaxy S2 and HTC Desire. This also applies to some of the iphone model devices between iPhone 4S and iOS 9; those that we&#8217;re release before iOS 9 but not before iphone 4S.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This, this implies that all iPhone models up to the iPhone 4 model will not be able to support the popular messaging app &#8211; WhatsApp, as these phones are not capable of updating to iOS 9 and rendered incompatible. However, owners of iphone 4S to iOS 9 can still update to a compatible operating system if they are yet to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phone owners will either see an updated Terms and Conditions when opening their WhatsApp messenger with the choice to agree or not, or can see the software update version their device is using by checking the settings section of the device.
