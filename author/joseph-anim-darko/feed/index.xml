<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understand Your Target Audience And Focus On User Experience</h2>



<p>You need to understand your target audience and what kind of content they are looking for. Conducting research and gathering insights on their demographics, interests, and behavior will help in creating relevant and engaging contents. For example, if your site provides fashion tips and trends, you can create content that showcases the latest styles and enables users to create their fashion lookbooks. Creating interactive and fresh content that is engaging and informative will help drive more traffic to your site, retain users, and generate returning visitors.</p>



<p><br>Google&#8217;s algorithms are designed to prioritize websites that provide a good user experience.

This includes using relevant keywords, optimizing headlines and meta descriptions, and internal and external linking.</p>

Backlinks indicate to search engines that your website is a reliable source of information, thereby increasing its authority. The more authority your website has, the more likely it is to appear higher in search engine rankings.</p>



<p>Have you ever wondered how voice assistants like Siri and Alexa have revolutionized the way we search for information? Voice search is rapidly gaining popularity, and those who optimize their online presence for voice queries can gain a competitive edge. There is a need to incorporate conversational language and long-tail keywords into your website content, you can enhance your chances of appearing in voice search results. For example, instead of targeting a keyword like &#8220;best coffee shop,&#8221; consider using a more natural and conversational phrase like &#8220;Where can I find the best coffee shop near me?&#8221; This strategy can help you align with the way people speak when using voice assistants, increasing your chances of getting noticed on Google.</p>



<p>You need to understand how consumers search using voice, so as to create content that drives traffic to your site through voice search. It is important to focus on creating content that is conversational and uses natural language.</p>



<p><br>Additionally, organizing your content with clear headers and subheaders helps voice assistants to quickly find relevant information and present it to consumers effectively. Providing, accurate, and informative answers that are easy to understand can also enhance your site&#8217;s credibility and drive traffic. All these combined will ensure that your site is optimized, attract organic traffic, and rank higher on Google or search engines.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This, this implies that all iPhone models up to the iPhone 4 model will not be able to support the popular messaging app &#8211; WhatsApp, as these phones are not capable of updating to iOS 9 and rendered incompatible. However, owners of iphone 4S to iOS 9 can still update to a compatible operating system if they are yet to do so.</p>



<p>Phone owners will either see an updated Terms and Conditions when opening their WhatsApp messenger with the choice to agree or not, or can see the software update version their device is using by checking the settings section of the device.

<p> <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>General </strong>>  <strong>Software update</strong>.<br></p>

<p>1. HTC Desire</p>



<p>2. Apple iPhone 1-4</p>



<p>3. Motorola Droid Razr</p>



<p>4. Samsung Galaxy S2</p>



<p>5. LG Optimus Black</p>



<p>6. Any Android released before 2010</p>



<p><strong>List Of Phones that will need to update to at least iOS9 or Android OS 4.0.3:</strong></p>



<p><strong>iPhone Models</strong>;</p>



<ul>
<li>IPhone 4S</li>



<li>IPhone 5</li>

<div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/0156f-img_20201009_041730-1-1-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://repentedanalyst.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/01633-img_20201009_041730.jpg" width="640" height="600" border="0"></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"></div>
<p>WhatsApp, The online prominent instant messaging platform, has now made available an updated feature &#8211; The mute feature, for all Android users which has been used by a lot of Android users worldwide since its release. This feature initially permits users to disallow message notifications from groups and individual contacts for a period of time specifically to suit the user, now allows it without any time limit.</p>
<p>This means users will not have to periodically revisit their mute decision to update it all the time. Until then, users could only mute notifications for 8 hours, 1 week, or a year in their WhatsApp settings, however, the recently launched option is now ‘Always’ and it is intended to replace the ‘1 year’ option.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/b48d0-img_20201009_034512-1-1-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://repentedanalyst.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/bc6dd-img_20201009_034512.jpg" width="562" height="640" border="0"></a></div>
<div>The ‘mute notification’ choice can be activated by tapping on the three dots at the top right corner in a chat window which then will allow you to select a duration of your choice. WhatsApp does not notify affected contact or group of this decision when initiated. You should note that muting a group or private chat will not necessarily stop their messages from trooping in, it will only stop notifying you about the messages from the groups or people you have muted.</p>
<p>Aside the general mute feature relating to messages, WhatsApp also enables users to mute their status updates. Muted statuses are usually hidden just below the list of permitted ones, but can be viewed at the user’s will. This mute option is one of WhatsApp&#8217;s own way of helping users to create barriers or boundaries on whom ever they decide to interact with or not on the platform and also to avoid unnecessary spams and annoying notifications from these people or groups.</p>
<p>However, the good thing about this is, it is only a modest restraint because the messages from muted contacts can still be found on the list of unread messages. Although a severe measure or action is the ‘block’ feature which is available on most social media platforms to prevent privacy invasion and spams. This avoids any form of dealings with contacts considered as threats but unfortunately, it cannot be used on WhatsApp groups. To compensate for that, the most helpful and effective way of preventing unwanted messages from those groups is to entirely exit the groups, which has been a lot of help to most people regarding invasion.</p>
<p>Apart from this, users can change their privacy settings to allow only known or specific contacts to add them to groups they prefer. As at now, both the mute and block actions can be reversed if the need be. For now, the ‘Always’ mute option has been added to the list of terrific features on the prominent messaging app &#8211; Whatsapp.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Meanwhile, aside the &#8216;mute forever&#8217; feature already existing in Telegram, there is another feature which enables messages or accounts to self-destruct after a period of long idle period of time may also be accommodated on WhatsApp platform in the future.</div>
